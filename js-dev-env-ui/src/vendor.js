/*  This file contains references to the vendor libraries we're using in this project.
    This is used by webpack in the production build only.
    All 3rd party libraries will be referenced here and written to vendor.js, so they can be cached until one of them changes.
    This avoids users having to download a huge JS file every time a line of our application code changes.
